      <description>Yule, in 1926, shows the consequences of regressing nonstationary series on one another. To replicate his result via simulation, let’s perform one. First, to generate two nonstationary series. Then regress them on each other and keep the p-value for the slope attached to \(y_2\).

      <description>Simulating Data Simulating data under an ARIMA model in R is made rather easy. From the documentation on arima in stats, we obtain that $$ X_t = a1 X{t-1} + a{2} X{t-2} + \ldots + a{p} X{t-p} + b1 \epsilon{t-1} + b[2] \epsilon{t-2} + \ldots + b{q} \epsilon{t-q} $$ by construction. This can be adjusted with the rand.gen argument.

      <description>Some Basic Time Series with Equities First, let me get some data using tidyquant.
tidyquant tidyquant automates a lot of equity research and calculation using tidy concepts. I will first use it to get the components of the S and P 500 and pick out those with weights over 1.1 percent. In the next step, I download the data and finally calculate daily returns and a cumulative wealth index.</description>

      <description>Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.

      <description>Part One One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
 He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
 The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</description>

      <title>Use @ instead of HEAD</title>

      <guid>/blog/use-at-instead-of-head/</guid>
      <description>I recently discovered that from git version 1.8.5 onwards, @ can replace HEAD:
$ git reset --hard @~2 $ git rebase -i @~10 $ git diff @~2..@~3  And also in most scenarios HEAD can be left out completely, so you can say:
$ git reset -- @{2}  instead of:
$ git reset -- HEAD@{2}  It takes some getting used to, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely faster than typing HEAD.</description>

# Beautiful forecasting can be quick and easy

1. I will grab the adjusted closing price of Ford stock (`F`) from January 1, 2018.  
2. Use the `forecast` package to find an ARIMA model and forecast it for 50 periods.  
3. Use `highcharter` to plot it inside a framewidget that is appropriate with the markdown.

```{r}
library(tidyquant)
library(forecast)
library(highcharter)
library(widgetframe)
A.Res <- "F" %>% tq_get(., from = "2018-01-01") %>% select(date, adjusted) 
A.Forecast <- forecast(auto.arima(A.Res$adjusted), level=0.95, n=50)
frameWidget(hchart(A.Forecast), width=600)
```
